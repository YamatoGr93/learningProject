# Encoding Demo

This project demonstrates various encoding techniques in Go. It includes functions to encode a given message using different encoding schemes such as Base64, ASCII, Hex, URL, ROT13, Binary, Octal, Caesar Cipher, Atbash, Base32, Base58, and Base85.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YamatoGr93/learningProject.git
   
2. This is a fun project to learn about encoding techniques in Go. You can run the program and encode a message using different encoding schemes. The program will prompt you to enter a message and then ask you to choose an encoding scheme. The encoded message will be displayed on the console.
